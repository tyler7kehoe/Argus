What is it: Setup
What it does: When the user runs /setup (admin priv's only) it will create channels and categories with the correct permissions. It will also create a base of set roles.

Note on setup: I would have the bot create the roles first then create channels and permissions with those roles. May save you from having to back track. IDK. 
Must have permission: Admin

Roles:
Verified= send messages, view channels, add reactions, embed links, connect, voice activity
Mods= All the above + kick, manage message
Lead Mods= All the above + ban
Core= Administrator




What is it: Opensea sales

What it does: Will automatically post opensea sales in an embed with things like in the image.

How it should work: Admin just needs to setup the sales channel and the bot should just need the channel and contract address.

Example: /opensea "sales channel" "0xABCDEFGH"

Example GIT: https://github.com/0xEssential/opensea-discord-bot (not sure if it's up to date)








Possibilites if there is time:

Notifications from twitch, twitter, etc
Maybe a leveling system
Add little fun games tiktaktoe, RPS, Connect 4, etc.
Polls



What we can do in the future:
Create a web UI to manage all of this outside of discord.
Create a paid feature of the bot where we hide things behind a pay wall
