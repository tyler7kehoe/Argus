If these could all be slash commands <3
  -> slash commands require ctx.respond() instead of ctx.send()




What is it: Help

What is does: Lists all of the commands and how to use them

Must have permission: ban_members





What is it: Reaction roles 

- DONE - 

Updates: 

Tests: Load with over 10 roles - make sure embed looks good





What is it: moderation

- DONE _

Commands: /get_blacklist /add_to_blacklist /remove_from_blacklist

Updates: raid protection, emoji spamming?





What is it: giveaway 

- DONE -

Updates: /reroll - cache people that entered into giveaway and didn't win. If reroll is called, randomly select from that list. 
         To save space, it would be best to clear entrants once a day from the database. 





What is it: Webhook Deleter

- DONE -

Updates: make it so the message is not deleted if sent by an admin? or people with certain permissions?
         - Create an on/off switch for webhooks allowed




What is it: Setup

  - DONE -

Note: Announcements channel is blocked by a paywall (user must set manually)

Roles:
Verified= send messages, view channels, add reactions, embed links, connect, voice activity
Mods= All the above + kick, manage message
Lead Mods= All the above + ban
Core= Administrator




What is it: Opensea sales

What it does: Will automatically post opensea sales in an embed with things like in the image.

How it should work: Admin just needs to setup the sales channel and the bot should just need the channel and contract address.

Example: /opensea "sales channel" "0xABCDEFGH"

Example GIT: https://github.com/0xEssential/opensea-discord-bot (not sure if it's up to date)





What is it: Polls

Implemenation idea: Like a giveaway but with reactions. Must be reactivated like a giveaway is if the bot restarts. The rest should be pretty streamlined.


Possibilites if there is time:

Notifications from twitch, twitter, etc
Maybe a leveling system
Add little fun games tiktaktoe, RPS, Connect 4, etc.





What we can do in the future:
Create a web UI to manage all of this outside of discord.
Create a paid feature of the bot where we hide things behind a pay wall
